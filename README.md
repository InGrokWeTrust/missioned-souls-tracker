# Missioned Souls Reaction Tracker

A three-part automation system that tracks YouTube reactions to **Missioned Souls** and posts new ones to Discord.

The system runs entirely on GitHub Actions, triggered externally by cron-job.org.

## 🎯 What It Does

| Script | Frequency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `autoreactions.py` | Every 30 min | Scans tracked channels' uploads for new reactions |
| `discover_channels.py` | Every 2 hours | Finds new reactor channels and updates the tracked list |
| `check_live_streams.py` | Every 2 hours | Detects active Missioned Souls live streams |

**Discord output:**
- New reactions: posted with title, channel, views, likes, comments, and "Posted: HH:MM (Xm ago)"
- Live streams: posted with `🔴 LIVE:` prefix and red sidebar
- Shorts: always filtered out

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Discovery (`discover_channels.py`)

- Searches YouTube for recent videos mentioning **Missioned Souls**
- Extracts unique channel IDs from results
- Adds new channels to `tracked_channels.json`
- Excludes vlog channels (except **Cherman Vlogs**)
- Prunes channels inactive for 60+ days
- Commits `tracked_channels.json` back to the repo

### 2. Tracking (`autoreactions.py`)

- Loads `tracked_channels.json`
- For each channel, fetches the 5 newest videos via `playlistItems.list`
- Filters titles to those containing **"Missioned Souls"**
- Filters out shorts (`#short`, `#shorts`, `"shorts"`, duration < 120s)
- Fetches stats + duration + `liveStreamingDetails` in one batch `videos.list` call
- Keeps live/upcoming/archived streams (via `liveStreamingDetails`)
- Compares against bookmark (`last_run.json`), sends new ones to Discord
- Updates bookmark

### 3. Live Streams (`check_live_streams.py`)

- Searches YouTube for **currently live** videos mentioning **Missioned Souls**
- Filters to titles containing "Missioned Souls"
- Uses ID-based deduplication (stored in `live_last_run.json`, capped at 200 IDs)
- Sends new live streams to Discord with `🔴 LIVE:` prefix
